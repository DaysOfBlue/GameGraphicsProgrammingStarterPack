# Lab 00: Project Setup

Students registered in the Game Graphics Programming course will conduct each lab based on Direct3D 11. Each lab works are an incremental development of a basic rendering engine, thus they are not independent. For this reason, we recommend the students to stay focused to the teaching assistant (TA). Through this lab, one can setup a Visual Studio project used throughout the course
